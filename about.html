  <h1>How I Got Started</h1>
  <p>I took a guitar class in junior high, and despite enjoying the class, I never followed through with the instrument. That was until I was in Puerto Rico, where the Guitar is very popular.
  Since returning from the island, I have been learning a lot and haven’t stopped playing since.</p>
